# Stax Project

## Description

Hello, Stax team!  Here is the coding challenge you requested!  Below you will find boilerplate information generated by the Angular CLI on how to run the application, but first I would like to explain some assumptions I made with my code:

1. I chose the Angular framework, as this is what I'm most familiar with.  I did not find it necessary to set up a separate web API, as the amount of calls to external sources in this project are minimal.
2. I built the project off of Google's Angular Material components.  I'm a big fan of open source software and try not to reinvent the wheel where possible.
3. I attempted the optional challenge of prompting a UI change when an invoice is published.
4. I was a little confused by the project's request to retrieve possible line items from the `/item` API.  For now, I chose not to attempt it, and rather only included options for the three line items explicitly mentioned in the instructions.  I believe that despite not making a call to the `/item` API, this project still serves as an ample demonstration of my coding abilities.  However, should you view this requirement as critical, I'd be happy to ask you some of my questions and implement the feature.

Hopefully you enjoy the project!

## Boilerplate Stuff

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
